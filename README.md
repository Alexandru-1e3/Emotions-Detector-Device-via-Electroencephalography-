Emotions Detector Device via Electroencephalography 

  The feelings side of the projects in the field of Electroencephalography are designed to
interpret the values of the EEG signal in ratio with the emotions and feelings they might mean.
This side of the EEG field considers more of the unpredictability and the nature of humans more
than the nature of the brain itself, since feelings are personal and different people might have
different responses to the same stimulus, based on their past experiences. These kinds of projects
are more present in universities, where they have people with a better understanding of
programing and computing, and a bigger number of volunteers. And by that they can
approximate the emotions values based on a large group with similar EEG values generated from
the same stimulus.

  The presented project is trying to findthe emotions of a person via their EEG signals.
It’s also an educational project, by being simple
enough to be able to make it without machine learning algorithms but difficult enough to push
me out of my comfort zone and to make learn about a new field. Its performance is at a medium
percentage in order of accuracy, speed, and efficiency. It is a great way for beginners to enter the
EGG field and to start learning about it and to see how their brain works.
The intention of this project is to make people aware of the way their emotions have
similarities with others and the differences between them. There is no need for very precise
equipment to do small college experiments and to draw scientific conclusions, but of course the
more precise the better.

  As a conclusion, of the role the project has in the entire field, it is a great way to enter the
field of Electroencephalography by learning and playing with it.
